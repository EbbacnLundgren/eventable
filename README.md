Hello and welcome to the Github of Eventable! 

We are four driven students and soon to be engineers who saw a gap in the market for a clear and structured Events application. We wanted to create a website that is easy to use and user friendly with nice designs. 

In Eventable, you can create events, you can copy the link for this event and share with your friends, you can see what is happening in a week, a month and even years - all events in one place. 

The webpage is hosted in Vercel.
