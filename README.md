# Eventable

Hello and welcome to the Github of Eventable!

We are four driven students and soon to be engineers who saw a gap in the market for a clear and structured Events application so we created it ourselves. We wanted to create a website that is easy to use and user friendly with nice designs.

With Eventable, you can create events, share them with friends using unique links, and explore all your upcoming activities across days, weeks, months or even years, all in one place.

The webpage is hosted in Vercel.

Checkout the webpage here: https://eventable.se
